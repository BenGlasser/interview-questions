⏺ Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive Terraform troubleshooting challenge
  repository. Here's a summary of what's been implemented:

  Key Features Implemented

  🔧 The Intentional Bug

  - App Runner VPC Connector placed in "app subnets" (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24)
  - Network ACL rules on app subnets DENY egress to Redis port 6379 to data subnets
  - Redis cluster correctly placed in "data subnets" (10.0.11.0/24, 10.0.12.0/24)
  - Security groups are correct (red herring - not the issue!)

  📱 Realistic Application

  - Node.js Express server with Redis client
  - /health endpoint returns detailed error information for troubleshooting
  - /set and /get endpoints for testing Redis operations
  - Comprehensive error handling with troubleshooting hints

  🛠️ Troubleshooting Tools

  - Progressive hints in README from basic to specific
  - Detailed investigation tasks with exact commands to run
  - Health monitoring script with colored output and JSON parsing
  - Comprehensive Terraform outputs for network debugging

  📚 Educational Content

  - Complete solution explanation covering NACL vs Security Group differences
  - Network layer analysis showing traffic flow and blocking points
  - Common troubleshooting mistakes and why they don't apply
  - Production best practices and monitoring recommendations

  💰 Cost Conscious

  - Uses smallest instance types (cache.t3.micro, 1vCPU/2GB App Runner)
  - Optional NAT Gateway (disabled by default)
  - ECR lifecycle policy to limit stored images
  - Clear cost warnings and teardown instructions

  How the Challenge Works

  1. Deploy infrastructure with terraform apply
  2. Build & push container with provided script
  3. Test /health endpoint - it fails with Redis connection timeout
  4. Investigate using systematic approach in TASKS.md
  5. Discover that VPC Connector subnets have NACLs blocking Redis traffic
  6. Fix by either moving connector to data subnets OR fixing NACL rules
  7. Verify that /health now returns {"redis":"ok"}

  The challenge is designed to take 60-90 minutes and tests understanding of:
  - AWS networking layers (NACLs → Security Groups → Application)
  - VPC Connector placement and subnet selection
  - Systematic network troubleshooting methodology
  - Terraform infrastructure debugging

  The repository is ready to use and provides a realistic, hands-on AWS troubleshooting
  experience that mirrors real production issues.
